  <h1>Ogg Vorbis Comment Field Recommendations</h1>

  <h2>Suggestions For Tagging Ogg Files</h2>

  <p class="centeritalic">Last updated Thu Jul 3 20:35:53 PDT 2003</p>

  <p class="centerbold">The following recommendations were developed by a
  community of Ogg/Vorbis users for their own use.</p>

  <p>You will find a mirror of this page <a href=
  "http://hobba.hobba.nl/audio/mirroredpages/ogg-tagging.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the set of tags in this recommendation is to provide
  information about the track that contains the tags. It is not the purpose
  of the tags to provide general information about the piece of music in the
  track, such as a listing of every recording that contains that same piece
  of music. External databases and the internal Ogg metadata stream are
  appropriate for information about the music, except where it fills one of
  the 4 goals listed below.</p>

  <h3>Goals:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Identify a track so the listener can know what he is listening
    to.</li>

    <li>Identify a track to allow music companies to profit from it.</li>

    <li>Meet goals 1 and 2 without access to external data sources.</li>

    <li>Identify a track within a database that contains information about
    the track.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>NOT goals:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Stuff every available bit of information about a track and the CD it
    is on into the TAGS section. (liner notes, lyrics, the bandleaders dogs
    name...)</li>

    <li>Backward compatibility with ID3 and MP3 tagging schemes, structures,
    and infrastructures.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Piracy happens. We can't prevent it. At least we can encourage less
  damaging behaviors, such as making sure than when someone likes a track,
  they have enough information to reimburse the artist by going out and
  purchasing the original source media the music came on.</p>

  <p>These recommendations are written in the context of <a href=
  "http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html">http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html</a>,
  which is authoritative.</p>

  <p>All tags are OPTIONAL; you can have an ogg file with NO tags present and
  it will still be compliant. It is RECOMMENDED that you put enough tags in
  the ogg to meet goals 1 through 4 above. The tags needed will vary with
  each recording, and will often be no more than the tags already used.</p>

  <p>Before we continue, here is a nifty bourne shell function you can stick
  in your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
ogg-grep () {
    REGEX="$1";
    shift;
    for i in "$@"; do
        vorbiscomment -l "$i"|grep -i "$REGEX" &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; echo "$i";
    done;
}
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You could use it like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
ogg-grep "CONDUCTOR=.*Karajan" ~/music/oggfiles/*.ogg
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It would display, one per line, all the ogg files where Karajan was the
  conductor of the piece.</p>

  <h2>What is the effect of following these Recommendations?</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>USERS:</dt>

    <dd>
      Users will be playing their oggs; their player software is expected to
      display the tags that exist in an oggfile, intelligently.

      <p>Therefore the users are not affected by these recommendations and
      need know nothing about them. Player programs ARE affected, and their
      job should be made as easy as possible.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>ENCODERS:</dt>

    <dd>
      There will be a subset of users who create ogg files. Inasmuch as it is
      their responsibility to tag their files correctly, it would be nice if
      they knew about these recommendations. However, their ripping software
      should make it trivial for them to fill in the correct tags in the
      common cases, and let them access the full tagset if they feel they
      need it.

      <p>Therefore, encoders will almost not notice the adoption of these
      recommendations, unless they wanted to benefit from its increased
      flexibility, in which case they will rejoice. Ripper and tagging
      SOFTWARE on the other hand will need to support these recommendations,
      and again, its job should be made as easy as possible.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>CODERS:</dt>

    <dd>
      Coders are those who write the software used by users and encoders.
      They are the ones who will need to make their software compliant, and
      the ones who need to make sure their software is easy for people to
      use.

      <p>Therefore, it is the coders who will be affected most by these
      recommendations. Their job should be made as easy as possible so they
      can support it trivially and well.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Compliance:</h2>

  <p>A compliant Ogg player program will intelligently display, or let the
  user specify how to display, all the tags in an Ogg file.</p>

  <p>A compliant Ogg file may contain tags not in these recommendations.</p>

  <p>Compliant tag editors and rippers may support tags not in these
  recommendations, but should encourage use of recommended tags over tags not
  in this document.</p>

  <h2>Character Set Encoding of Tags:</h2>

  <p>UTF-8 is the default encoding for tag data. Unfortunately UTF-8 muffed
  it for Asian languages by doing the equivalent of giving the same character
  codes to English, Russian, and Greek letters.</p>

  <p>Fortunately UTF-8 itself has an internal, standard solution to the
  problem: <a href=
  "http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27/#tag">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27/#tag</a>
  which basically says: mark the language of text with U+E0001 LANGUAGE TAG,
  followed by the <a href=
  "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt">RFC&nbsp;3066</a> language ID (ie.
  "ja") encoded in lowercase ASCII plus 0xE0000. This is the only mechanism
  recognized by this document.</p>

  <p>Programs which don't want to interpret such markup can simply ignore it;
  it is zero width. The scope of the language setting is until the end of the
  tag, or until a new language setting is encountered, whichever comes
  first.</p>

  <h2>We have the following STANDARD tags:</h2>

  <p>Singleton tags, which should only appear once. If one of these tags
  appears more than once, its last appearance should be displayed if there is
  only room to display one instance of the tag.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>ALBUM</dt>

    <dd>if appropriate, an album name</dd>

    <dt>ARTIST</dt>

    <dd>for information to be displayed on systems with limited display
    capabilities. it is not a replacement for the ENSEMBLE and PERFORMER
    tags, but typically will summarize them.</dd>

    <dt>PUBLISHER</dt>

    <dd>who publishes the disc the track came from</dd>

    <dd>the record label or imprint on the disc</dd>

    <dt>LABELNO</dt>

    <dd>record labels often put the catalog number of the source media

    <dt>TRACKNUMBER</dt>

    <dd>the track number on the CD</dd>

    <dt>VERSION</dt>

    <dd>Make sure you don't put DATE or LOCATION information in this tag.
    "live", "acoustic", "Radio Edit" "12 inch remix" might be typical values
    of this tag</dd>

    <dt>ENCODED-BY</dt>

    <dd>The person who encoded the Ogg file. May include contact information
    such as email address and phone number.</dd>

    <dt>ENCODING</dt>

    <dd>Put the settings you used to encode the Ogg file here. This tag is
    NOT expected to be stored or returned by cddb type databases. It includes
    information about the quality setting, bit rate, and bitrate management
    settings used to encode the Ogg. It also is used for information about
    which encoding software was used to do the encoding.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The remaining tags are multiples; if they are present more than once,
  all their occurances are considered significant.</p>

  <dl>

    (violinist)</dd>

    <dt>ENSEMBLE</dt>

    <dd>the group playing the piece, whether orchestra, singing duo, or rock
    and roll band.</dd>

    <dt>PART</dt>

    <dd>a division within a work; eg, a movement of a symphony. Some tracks
    contain several parts. Use a single PART tag for each part contained in a
    track. ie, PART="Oh sole mio"</dd>

    <dt>PARTNUMBER</dt>

    <dd>The part number goes in here. You can use any format you like, such
    as Roman numerals, regular numbers, or whatever. The numbers should be
    entered in such a way that an alphabetical sort on this tag will
    correctly show the proper ordering of all the oggs that contain the
    contain the piece of music.</dd>

    <dt>GENRE</dt>

    <dd>like the genre tag from the <a href="http://www.cddb.com/">cddb</a>
    but without the limitations. You can put any genre you want in this tag.
