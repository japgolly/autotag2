<H1 align=center>Replay Gain - A Proposed Standard</H1>
<H2 align=center>Replay Gain Data Format</H2>
<H3>What to store</H3>
<P align=justify>Three values must be stored. </P>
<OL class=important>
  <LI><A href="peak.html">Peak signal amplitude</A> 
  <LI>"Radio" = Replay Gain adjustment required to make all tracks equal 
  loudness 
  <LI>"Audiophile" = Replay Gain adjustment required to give ideal listening 
  loudness </LI></OL>
<P align=justify>If calculated on a track-by-track basis, ReplayGain yields (2). 
If calculated on a disc-by-disc basis, ReplayGain will usually yield (3), though 
this value may be more accurately determined by a human listener if required. 
</P>
<P align=justify><B>To allow for future expansion:</B> If more than three values 
are stored, players should ignore those they do not recognise, but process those 
that they do. If additional Replay Gain adjustments other than "Radio" and 
"Audiophile" are stored, they should come <I>after</I> "Radio" and "Audiophile". 
The Peak Amplitude must always occupy the first 4 bytes of the Replay Gain 
header frame. The three values listed above (or at least fields to hold the 
three values, should the values themselves be unknown) are <B>required</B> in 
all Replay Gain headers. </P>
<H3>Range</H3>
<P align=justify>The replay gain adjustment must be between -51.0dB and +51.0dB. 
Values outside this range must be limited to be within the range, though they 
are certainly in error, and should probably be re-calculated, or stored as "not 
set". For example, trying to cause a silent 24-bit file to play at 83dB will 
yield a replay gain adjustment of +57dB. </P>
<P align=justify>In practice, adjustment values from -23dB to +17dB are the 
likely extremes, and values from -18dB to +2dB are more usual. </P>
<H3>Bit format</H3>
<P align=justify>Each Replay Gain value should be stored in a Replay Gain 
Adjustment field consisting of two bytes (16 bits). Here are two example Replay 
Gain Adjustment fields: </P><PRE><FONT face=Courier,fixed>

<P align=justify>In the above example, the Radio Gain Adjustment is -12.5dB, and 
was calculated automatically. The Audiophile Gain Adjustment is +2.0dB, and was 
set by the user. </P>
<H3>- Name code</H3>

<P align=justify>If space has been reserved for the Replay Gain in the file 
header, but no replay gain calculation has been carried out, then all bits 
(including the Name code) may be zero. </P>
<P align=justify>For each Replay Gain Adjustment field, if the name code = 000 
(not set), then players should ignore the rest of that individual field. </P>
<P align=justify>For each Replay Gain Adjustment field, if the name code is an 
unrecognised value (i.e. not 001-Radio or 010-Audiophile), then players should 
ignore the rest of that individual field. </P>
<P align=justify>If no valid Replay Gain Adjustment fields are found (i.e. all 
name codes are either 000 or unknown), then the player should proceed as if the 
file contained no Replay Gain Adjustment information (see <A 
href="player_scale.html#absent">player requirements</A>). 
<H3>- Originator code</H3>
<DIV align=center>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>000 = </TD>
    <TD>Replay Gain unspecified</TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>other = </TD>
    <TD>reserved for future use</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>
<P align=justify>For each Replay Gain Adjustment field, if the name code is 
valid, but the Originator code is 000 (Replay Gain unspecified), then the player 
should ignore that Replay Gain adjustment field. </P>
<P align=justify>For each Replay Gain Adjustment field, if the name code is 
valid, but the Originator code is unknown, then the player should <B>still</B> 
use the information within that Replay Gain Adjustment field. This is because, 
even if we are unsure as to how the adjustment was determined, <I>any</I> valid 
Replay Gain adjustment is more useful than none at all. </P>
<P align=justify>If no valid Replay Gain Adjustment fields are found (i.e. all 
originator codes are 000), then the player should proceed as if the file 
contained no Replay Gain Adjustment information (see <A 
href="player_scale.html#absent">player requirements</A>). 
<H3>- Sign bit</H3>

<H3>- Replay Gain Adjustment</H3>
<P align=justify>The value, multiplied by ten, stripped of its sign (since the + 
or - is stored in the "sign" bit), is represented in 9 bits. e.g. -3.1dB becomes 
31 = 000011111. </P>
<H3>Default Value</H3>
<P align=justify>$00 $00 (0000000000000000) should be used where no Replay Gain 
has been calculated or set. This value will be interpreted by players in the 
same manner as a file without a Replay Gain field in the header (see <A 
href="player_scale.html#absent">player requirements</A>). </P>
<P align=justify>The values of xxxyyy0000000000 (where xxx is any name code, and 
yyy is any originator code) are all valid, but indicate that the Replay Gain is 
to be left at 83dB (0dB Replay Gain Adjustment). These are <B>not</B> default 
values, and should only be used where appropriate (e.g. where the user, 
producer, or Replay Gain calculation has indicated that the correct Replay Gain 
<B>is</B> 83dB). </P>
<H3>Illegal Values</H3>
<P align=justify>The values xxxyyy1000000000 are all illegal. You cannot have 
negative zero! These values may be used to convey other information in the 
future. They must not be used at present. If enountered, players should treat 
them in the same manner as $00 $00 (the default value). </P>
<P align=justify>The value $xx $ff is <B>not</B> illegal, but it would give a 
false synch value within an mp3 file. The problems this may cause should be 
investigated, and a solution (e.g. <A 
href="../../../www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0.html#sec5">unsychronisation</A>) sought. 
Maybe this is a use for negative zero? </P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
<P align=justify>Please <A href="contact.html">contact me</A> if you have 
implemented any software which makes use of this format. </P>
<H3>Suggestions and further work</H3>
<P align=justify>Please <A href="contact.html">contact me</A> if you anticipate 
any problems with this data format. </P>
