Tags are easily modifed/overwritten/lost.
You should never have to manually type the track name, artist name etc etc more than once ever.
THIS APP relies on properly named files, and/or autotag.txt files so you never have to edit a song's metadata more than once.
If the tags ever get erased or modified, simply re-run THIS APP.
THIS APP reads songs' tags first. You can set it to preserve certain tag fields (replaygain data for instance).
Also, it does not update files that already contain up-to-date tags. Therefore you can run it over your whole collection any time just to make sure, and it will take next to no time.

All configuration options are located in a single file. Easy to change config.
100% open source. You can modify for your own purposes.
